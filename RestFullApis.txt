Here are the step-by-step commands you can use in the VS Code terminal (or any terminal) to merge the basic-backend branch into the main branch on Windows:

Commands to Merge Branches:
Navigate to Your Repository:


cd path/to/your/repository
Ensure You Are on the main Branch:


git checkout main
This switches to the main branch where the merge will take place.

Pull Latest Changes (Optional but Recommended): Ensure your main branch is up-to-date with the remote repository:


git pull origin main
Merge the basic-backend Branch:

git merge basic-backend
This integrates the changes from basic-backend into the main branch.

Resolve Merge Conflicts (if any):

If there are conflicts, Git will pause the merge and show the conflicted files.
Open the conflicted files in VS Code, resolve them, and mark them as resolved:


git add path/to/resolved-file
Once all conflicts are resolved, complete the merge:



git commit
Push the Updated main Branch to Remote:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Verifying the Merge:
To check if the merge was successful:

bash
Copy code
git log --oneline
You should see the commits from the basic-backend branch reflected in the main branch's history.

Additional Notes:
Before Merging, ensure your local basic-backend branch is up-to-date with the remote:

bash
Copy code
git checkout basic-backend
git pull origin basic-backend
If you encounter any issues, feel free to describe them for further assistance!

To forcefully push your code to GitHub, you can use the git push --force (or git push -f) command. However, use this command cautiously, as it can overwrite changes in the remote repository, potentially leading to data loss if others are collaborating on the same branch.

Command for Force Push:
bash
Copy code
git push origin branch-name --force
